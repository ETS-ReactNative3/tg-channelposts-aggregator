# Telegram channels' posts aggregator

üöß ...Work in progress... üöß

üì© üì≠ Aggregates posts from your telegram channel(s) assigned to your bot(s) (must be an admin), filters the data, saves it into MongoDB & renders the data using React (see the **client** folder).

# Features

- [telegraf.js](https://telegraf.js.org/#/?id=features)
- [cheerio](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cheerio)
- [sync-request](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sync-request) but consider [then-request](https://github.com/then/then-request)
- [normalize-url](https://www.npmjs.com/package/normalize-url)
- @multifeed_edge_bot to aggregate and [redirect](https://github.com/galakhov/tg-channelposts-aggregator/tree/master/server) messages from a set of channels

# Server Tools / DB

I suggest to use Robo 3T or similar tools to monitor your local MongoDB installation.

For testing purposes you can use the free [MongoDB Atlas Cluster](https://docs.atlas.mongodb.com/reference/free-shared-limitations/#atlas-free-tier). Just follow [this](https://docs.atlas.mongodb.com/getting-started/#create-an-service-account) tutorial.

# Architecture / Required Puzzles

## Bot #1: Posts Collector

I'm using the [@multifeed_edge_bot](https://telegra.ph/Help---multifeed-edge-bot-07-06) bot for [automatic messages redirections](https://telegra.ph/Add-new-redirection-on-multifeed-edge-bot-07-06) from a set of chosen Telegram channels to my own private channel I've created.

## Bot #2: Data Processing

I've created another bot with the Telegram's [BotFather](https://core.telegram.org/bots#6-botfather) and saved the provided BOT_TOKEN in the `.env` file. I've then assigned this bot to my channel (must be an admin), which monitors (see: bot.on(['channel_post'] ...)) the new posts and posts' changes: bot.on(['edited_channel_post'] ...) on my channel.

This bot is configured internally to send all new posts first to the main controller (see ./bot/index.js and ./api/controllers/dashController.js). The controller processes the incoming bot's data accordingly.

Even though this setup would also work in production, I'd suggest to install and configure this 2nd bot on your VPS or elsewhere.

# Set up

Create new file in the `./server`'s root directory:

```
touch .env
```

Put the required lines into the `.env` file and fill in the required constants (at least add your BOT_TOKEN hash):

```
NODE_ENV=development
NODE_PATH=
PUBLIC_URL=

DB_HOST=localhost
DB_USER=root
DB_PASSWORD=pass
DB_NAME=db_name

HOST=
PORT=
CI=

BOT_TOKEN=123456789:AAH54XXXMBUXXXPz4XX-fbeXXXTXYYYY
```

# Debugging

Debugging a node application on a VPS, cloud, or a dedicated server can be tricky. For simple debugging I'd suggest to use such tools as: `pm2 logs --lines 500` or `node --inspect-brk=0.0.0.0:9229 server.js`. Both tools can be started if you change to an application's directory using a terminal/bash's `cd` command. PM2 will be installed globally during `postinstall` procedure (see package.json).

Read this [pm2 documentation](http://pm2.keymetrics.io/docs/usage/pm2-doc-single-page/) for more details.
