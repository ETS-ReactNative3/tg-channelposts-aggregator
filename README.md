## The Setup

My set-up is a healthy combination of the containers arranged into a Docker Swarm Stack, the Docker Hub Registry's with [automated builds](https://docs.docker.com/docker-hub/builds/), [Traefik (v2)](https://docs.traefik.io) and the self-hosted lightweight container-first CI/CD platform called [Drone.io](https://drone.io) with couple of [plugins](http://plugins.drone.io).

The set-up is somewhat similar to the one presented in this [post](https://habr.com/ru/post/476368/), which outlines a CI/CD pipeline entirely based on the GitHub Actions and some bash scripts, executed via SSH on a VPS. Besides the redundant configuration of the Docker Hub's secrets and the recurring logins, author [hard-codes](https://github.com/dementevda/actions_ci_example/blob/master/.github/workflows/pub_on_release.yaml) a deployment webhook, i.e. a full _curl_ POST request to his own custom endpoint, into the `deploy` step of the pipeline. That's an overkill.

If you connect your Docker Hub account with a GitHub repository you actually don't need to configure any secrets, use any GitHub Actions, nor any commands to build & push containers (**step 5**, _Figure 1_). With a pre-configured automated build for each microservice, Docker Hub Registry (re-)builds and (re-)places a container by itself, provided there was a push event.

For instance, I have two containers in the current GitHub repository with the corresponding Dockerfiles for the frontend and for the backend: `./client/Dockerfile.prod` and `./server/Dockerfile.prod`. The configuration of the frontend's container is shown in the image below:

<img src="./_manual/images/02 Docker Hub ‚Äî Automated Frontend Builds Configuration (Dockerfile in Production).jpg" width="1024" alt="Automated Frontend Configuration of the Docker Build">
<sub><strong>Figure 2. Automated docker build: frontend container's configuration.</strong></sub>

These two containers are (re-)built and saved in the Docker Hub Registry every time I push any new changes to the repository.

> To avoid any mis-configuration, it's recommended to verify the GitHub's Webhooks (https://github.com/{github-user}/{github-repo}/settings/hooks), which are being added by Docker Hub, after the set-up of the automated build(s) in the Docker Account: https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/{organisation-name}/{repo-name}/builds/edit.

As for the (re-)deployment, in my case [Drone CI/CD tool](https://docs.drone.io) is responsible for it as well as for the notification about the build's status. The new Docker containers are pulled and the Docker Swarm Stack is updated after the [execution of one single command](https://github.com/galakhov/tg-channelposts-aggregator/blob/dockerized/.drone.yml#L66) in the end via the [Drone SSH plugin](http://plugins.drone.io/appleboy/drone-ssh/) on a VPS:

```bash
docker stack deploy -c /path/to/docker-compose-stack-file.yml {stack-name}
```

It is always possible to update services in a stack one after another, [applying the rolling update](https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/swarm-tutorial/rolling-update/) to each microservice separately:

```bash
docker service update {SERVICE-NAME}
```

### Drone.io insights

#### Docker Hub's outgoing webhooks

The **step 6** of the _Figure 1_ is all about Docker Hub Webhooks that are ["(...) POST requests sent to a URL you define in Docker Hub"](https://docs.docker.com/docker-hub/webhooks/) by default.

To trigger the _deploy_ step in the Drone CI/CD platform after the containers were built, you need to set up the webhook in the Docker Hub in one of your repositories, preferably in the repository that's built last of all:

```bash
https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/{organisation-name}/{repo-name}/webhooks
```

The Webhook name is not important, but the Webhook URL is crucial and is explained in detail in the next section.

#### What Webhook URLs are allowed by the Drone.io's API?

To process an external call we use the built-in [Drone.io's REST API endpoint](https://docs.drone.io/api/overview/), which receives GET, POST, DELETE and other external requests.

Accessing this endpoint, you can, for instance, view the list of the recent deployments (the deployments in the Drone CI/CD platform are called _builds_) in your repository by sending the following **GET** request using _curl_ or just by opening this page in your browser:

```bash
http://YOUR_IP_OR_DNS:PORT/api/repos/{github-owner}/{repo-name}/builds
```

However, we need to trigger our pipeline and start a new _build_, which will then pull all the required newly built containers from Docker Hub. To run the [pipeline](./.drone.yml) and the deploy step in particular, a build needs to be [invoked](https://docs.drone.io/api/builds/build_create/) with the `custom` [event type](https://docs.drone.io/pipeline/triggers/#by-event). A new build with the corresponding pipeline commands will then be started after the webhook in form of the **POST** request is received:

```bash
POST http://YOUR_IP_OR_DNS:PORT/api/repos/{github-owner}/{repo-name}/builds?branch={branch-in-the-repo-with-the-drone-yml-pipeline-file}
```

It would have been enough if the API endpoint were public. The part on how to accomplish an authorized POST request without curl and the part about _/builds_ parameters are so far (March, 2020) quite badly documented. By the way, the personal bearer authorization token generated by Drone.io itself can be found in the account settings: http://YOUR_IP_OR_DNS:PORT/account.

In the Docker Hub there is, however, no way to send POST requests like you would do it on [reqbin.com](https://reqbin.com) with an option to choose the type of authorization, etc. So what does the Webhook URL should look like to be the valid request that satisfies the Drone.io endpoint?

It turns out, you can send an authorized POST request by passing over the **?access_token=** parameter that, among [other parameters](https://github.com/drone/drone/issues/2679), is being [validated during the creation of a build](https://github.com/drone/drone/blob/3fcbf1c78f44c4b592d17b009982578215994bd1/handler/api/repos/builds/create.go#L91). The final _Webhook URL_, triggering a new build, is then should look like this:

```bash
http://YOUR_IP_OR_DNS:PORT/api/repos/{github-owner}/{repo-name}/builds?branch={branch-in-the-repo-with-the-drone-yml-pipeline-file}&access_token={authorization-token}
```

You can omit the `branch` parameter and use the default GitHub's repo branch instead.
