# Telegram channels' posts aggregator

üöß ...Work in progress... üöß

## The Set-Up

My set-up of the self-hosted Drone CI platform is inspired by the [post](https://habr.com/ru/post/476368/) that describes CI/CD using GitHub Actions and some bash scripts on a VPS. However, I'm using Docker Hub's [automated builds](https://docs.docker.com/docker-hub/builds/) instead of the step 5 described in the figure 1 and Docker Swarm for the orchestration on the VPS.
